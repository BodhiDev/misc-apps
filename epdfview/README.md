# epdfview

The URL in the old package points to http://trac.emma-soft.com/epdfview, the link is dead.

The website of the (former?) developer, Emma-Soft doesn't mention ePDFview anywhere. I have difficulty finding information about it.

Therefore we are using a fork: https://github.com/jristz/epdfview
